# Changelog

Notable changes to the methodology. A change here can invalidate an artifact that already
exists, so each entry says what it would take to bring one forward.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). There is no release
numbering: `core/` is the contract, and schemas carry their own versions.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Executable workflow engine (`wgf`).** `core/workflows/new-game.workflow.yaml` defines the
  work from research to release preparation as data; `scripts/wgflib/workflow/` runs it —
  step registry, retry with backoff, failure routing (`verify` fail → `develop`), human
  checkpoints tied to gates, resume, idempotent re-entry, events and a file store in
  `.factory/`. `bin/wgf` exposes `new-game`, `research`, `plan`, `init`, `assets`, `develop`,
  `sdk`, `verify`, `release`, `status`, `logs`, `runs`, `pause` and `cancel`, all through
  one engine. Every step is a placeholder (`--mock`) that emits schema-valid artifacts;
  nothing is researched, built or published. `workspace/config/factory.yaml` configures it.
  `check-integrity.py` now validates workflow files. Existing artifacts are unaffected.

- **`tech_plan.repo_params.game_config.monetization`** — the ad kinds a title commits to,
  carried into the game repository. Platform profiles assert on `package.uses_banner_ads` and
  `package.uses_rewarded_ads`, and on GameVui the latter is blocking; but observing a run can
  only prove an ad *was* requested, never that one is never requested. Without a declaration
  reaching the game repository, those assertions could not be evaluated honestly. Derived from
  `game_design.monetization.placements[].kind` — not decided in the tech plan.

  *Migration:* optional. An existing tech plan stays valid; a game repository built from one
  without it measures both ad facts as `false`.

- **`scripts/wgf-org-setup.sh`** — creates and reconciles the organization's `WGF_*` Actions
  secrets and variables for the game pipelines. Idempotent, and the living inventory of what
  the organization should hold. It never rewrites an existing secret's value: GitHub cannot
  return one, so `gh secret set` on an existing name would replace a real credential with the
  sentinel.

### Changed

- **`criteria-expression` now states which way `in` and `not_in` read.** Platform profiles use
  `{left: package.locales, op: in, right: [ru]}` to mean "the package ships Russian". Read as
  the conventional "left is a member of right", that assertion passes for a package with no
  locales at all — and locale assertions are blocking on three platforms. The operator
  description now fixes the semantics: an array measurement asks whether every element of
  `right` is present in it; a scalar measurement asks whether it appears in `right`.

  *Migration:* none to the data. Any evaluator written against the old reading must be
  corrected, and its locale results re-checked.

### Notes from implementing the template's pipelines

Findings that belong with the methodology even though the code lives in the sibling repository:

- A **gate needs a mechanism, not a name**. `environment: production` in a workflow is not a
  gate — GitHub creates an unconfigured environment implicitly, with no protection, the first
  time a job names one. G6 and G7 are enforced by *required reviewers* on that environment, and
  the workflows now verify that rather than assume it.
- **Required reviewers are unavailable on private repositories under a free plan.** A private
  game repository on a free organization cannot enforce G6 or G7 through environments at all.
  Worth deciding per title, since `repo_params.visibility` defaults to `private`.
- **Platform profiles must be vendored into the game repository** at the pinned version. A game
  repository has no access to `core/`, and `platform-validation.md` names validating against
  the current profile rather than the pinned one as a failure mode. They go to
  `config/platforms/` as byte-identical copies, so drift is a plain diff.
- **Only Poki has a headless upload path.** Yandex, CrazyGames and GameVui accept a ZIP through
  a console a person logs into. `publish.md` already says no portal APIs are integrated by
  design; this is the same conclusion arrived at from the other direction.

## 2026-09-22 — initial

- `core/`: four lifecycle machines, seven gates as data, thirteen artifact schemas with their
  contracts in `x-wgf`, five platform profiles, twelve role charters, adapter bindings.
- `claude-web-game-plugin/` and `codex-web-game-plugin/`, generated from `gen-adapters.sh`.
- `workspace/`: a complete worked example from a market claim to a kill decision at G4.
- `scripts/check-integrity.py` for referential integrity across machines, schemas, roles and
  bindings.
